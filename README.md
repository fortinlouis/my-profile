# Welcome to My Projects!

Thank you for visiting my projects repository. Before we dive into the code, I want to share some information about my choice of platform and why I've decided not to use GitHub.

## Why I Don't Use GitHub

### Commitment to Open Source Technologies
I work on a daily basis with open source technologies such as Linux, Tutanota as my mail client, /e/OS on my phone, and many others. I strongly believe in the principles of open source and prefer to support and use open-source platforms for my projects.

### Avoiding GAFAM Products
In my quest to avoid supporting GAFAM (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft) products and services, I have made a conscious decision not to use GitHub. GitHub, as many of you know, is owned by Microsoft. While Microsoft has made strides in supporting open source, I prefer to use platforms that align more closely with my values and beliefs.

### Preference for GitLab
Instead of GitHub, I host my projects on GitLab. GitLab is an open-core platform that offers similar features to GitHub but with a stronger focus on openness, collaboration, and community. I find GitLab to be more aligned with my principles and objectives.

## Join Me on GitLab
If you're interested in exploring my projects, contributing, or collaborating, I invite you to visit my GitLab page:

[GitLab: lfortin](https://gitlab.com/lfortin)

Feel free to explore my repositories, raise issues, submit pull requests, or simply connect with me on GitLab. I look forward to collaborating with you in the open-source community!

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,
Louis
